Hello, and welcome to this blog post where I will guide you through my Google Data Analytics Capstone Project!

For the past few months I've been persuing my certification in Data Analytics offered by Google. When time came for me to do my Capstone Project, I knew I had to do it in a topic that I'm really passionate about: Gender Equality.

> “Gender equality is a core principle of the European Union, but it is not yet a reality. In business, politics and society as a whole, we can only reach our full potential if we use all of our talent and diversity. Using only half of the population, half of the ideas or half of the energy is not good enough.” 
>
> EU President Ursula von der Leyen

Being a woman in STEM, I went through a fair share of issues regarding Equality: from the lack of representation during my Bachelor's Degree to some instances of sexism during job search. Althought our society has been evolving quite considerably in this regard over the last decade, still a lot needs to be done.

As such, the European Union has been setting goals and tracking metrics over the last few years to measure the evolution of its member states regarding Gender Equality. It also has set several goals for Equality to be archieved by 2025 (you can check the full factsheet of goals [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/aid_development_cooperation_fundamental_rights/gender_equality_strategy_factsheet_en.pdf)).

Also, several studies have been conducted by the EU to measure this Gender Equality issues, which can be found [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/gender-equality_en).

So, if the European Union is actively working on Gender Equality, why should I chose this topic for my analysis?

Several reasons:
* Although EU analysis come from reputable sources, I believe that some level of fact cross checking is healthy;
* I always question myself if a private citizen would be able to get access the data to be able to conduct similar analysis;
* I found that engaging with a problem through data helps me understand it more deeply and have a more educated opinion. I am also aware of confirmation bias, so I promise I'm doing my best to proceed with this analysis with an open mind!

For this Project I will be using the Analysis framework proposed by Google that consists in 6 steps: 

Ask - Prepare - Process - Analyze - Share - Act. 

The first 4 steps will be described during this blog post, and the last 2 steps will be presented in a separate blog post.

With all of this being said, shall we begin?

# Ask

As stated previously, this analysis 

* How have the member states evolved in regards to Equality?
* Which member states are closer (and farther) from Equality?
* Is gender disparity still an issue in today's Europe?

# Prepare

In this step of the Capstone Project, we will explore the steps needed to prepare the data for exploration.

### Data Origin

The data that I will need to conduct my Analysis of Equality in the European Union comes from the Portuguese Data Platform [Pordata](https://www.pordata.pt/Europa), where I explored the "Europe" data available. 

I chose [Pordata](https://www.pordata.pt/) to obtain my data because it is a highly reliable source, founded by the Government and it is in direct contact its European counterparts. It is also easily available and open source, with verified and cited sources.

Note that this platform is available in Portuguese (my mother tongue), therefore the raw data presented will be in Portuguese.

### Data Location

I decided to complete this Analysis Project using the tools taught during the Certificate. Therefore, I created a folder on my personal Google Drive where I will be storing this project and all the deliverables produced during this project.

You can check the Project Folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eF9Sa3jrtMuCDA4RcmnxFfg-Dwkbu65I?usp=sharing).

For the prepare phase, I created a Data Folder, divided into two subfolders:
* Raw Data, where the data is as extracted from **Pordata**, one file per topic with names and text in Portuguese;
* Clean Data, where I stored one file with all the clean data (per sheet) and description of the contents of each sheet. This file can will then be copied for further Analysis.

### Does this Data ROCCC?

YES!!! :)

* **R**eliability: the Source is well veted;
* **O**riginal: the data comes from sources who collected it directly;
* **C**omprehensive: this data is presented for all the menber States of the EU;
* **C**urrent: the data is presented for about 20 years, 2020 being the most recent point of data;
* **C**ited: this data comes from the original sources of the European Union.
