Hi!

In this blog post I'm going to talk about a course in Data Visualization that I completed recently in the Udemy platform.

You can find the forementioned course here: [Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop/)

In my past professional experiences, all the companies I worked for used the Microsoft tech stack. For data related projects this was not an exception, and I saw my fair share of reports built in Microsoft Excel (and some of them were built by myself). But in a world where new Data is constantly streaming, reports are not enough, therefore the need for Dashboards that allow the end-user to get access to the latest values and also provide a fair amount of exploration freedom. 

Although there are several Data Visualization tools available in the market, due to my job environment I felt that it was imperative for me to dig deep into Microsoft PowerBI. Since Udemy is one of my favourite learning platforms, I searched for a course that included all the fundamentals of Microsoft PowerBI and found the highly rated [Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop/) course by Maven Analytics.

I decided to undertake this course because it offered a compreensive introduction to the Microsoft PowerBI tool, from building data models, to Dax calculations and Visualization tools.

After finishing this course, here is my detailed review:

#### Tools

This Course offers the students 2 datasets to work with, one alongside the instructor and other as a final test to access the learning. I found these datasets to be very relevant and appropriated, and both reflect case studies very similar to real-life work scenarios.

#### Data Modelation

I found this part of the course to be quite thorough and complete. The instructor delves deep into the good practices of building a star schema, the importance of correctly identifying keys and relationships (and the implications when creating filters in the report) and also good practices for presenting the model.

I was very well impressed with this Chapter mainly because this course is presented as a beginner course, and as a professional with extensive experience with Data Models myself, I felt that the instructor laid a very solid foundation for posterior learning.

#### DAX Calculations

In pace with the previous Chapter, this Chapter is also very thorough and complete in laying a solid foundation for beginners that have previously never contacted with DAX. Even if you have previous experience with DAX in Microsoft Excel, this course will work as a great refresher and you might also learn a few nifty new tricks. Once again the instructor is very well versed in this matter and it shows.

#### Microsoft PowerBI Visuals

For me personally, this Chapter was the one that I had a few issues with. Although it serves as a great reference point for Visuals and what you can do with them, I found this Chapter to be a bit outdated (the Course was created in 2018 and Microsoft PowerBI is constantly evolving) to the point that even the extra cards with new fields that the instructor presented are outdated themselves. Still a great introduction, specially because you're building a report alongside the instructor.

#### AI Visuals

I found this Chapter to be a little bit irrelevant and outdated. When I finished this course, all the Visuals presented were completely different from what the instructor presented, and I also felt these visuals to be a little bit of a * niche * need that might not be targeted to beginners. Obviously is very important to observe the full scope of the tool, but I personally feel that this Chapter didn't add much to the rest of the Course.

### Conclusion

To conclude, I found this Course to be a great tool for someonae who is starting their journey in Data Visualization but also a great refresher / reference point for more advanced users.

Bellow you can find one of the Dashboards that I prepared during this course and the certificate of completion.
