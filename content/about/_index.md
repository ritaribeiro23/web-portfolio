So, you want to know more about me? You came to the right place! :smile:

I was born in Guimar√£es in 1991 and had a pretty typical childhood and adolescency.
When time came to go to college, I enrolled in Physics at School of Sciences - Universidade do Porto, which meant that I would relocate to the city of Porto. I gladly did so and instantly fell in love with my new city!

Unfortunately, Physics didn't work out for me and I switched to Computer Science at the same School, which I graduated from in 2016. I found my true passion in programming, solving problems using logic and developing ever more complex lines of thought.

After graduation from my Bachelor's Degree, I took a gap year to explore what I would like to study as a Master's Degree.
After some soul searching (I really enjoy diverse fields of Computer Science, from Embedded Systems to Data Bases and Computer Simulation) I enrolled in the Master's Degree in Data Analytics at School of Economics and Management - University of Porto, where I'm currently enrolled and about to finish my Master's Thesis.

At the end of my first year enrolled in my Master's, I was awarded a scholarship to attend the European Innovation Academy (EIA), where I had the privilege of experience 3 incredible weeks learning the fundamentals of Entrepreneurship with student and mentors from all over the world.

After EIA was over, I was recruited to work at Continente Online (the biggest retail website in Portugal) as a BI Developer, It was my first big professional challenge, and it was oh so very rewarding! I learn a lot of what it takes to build a brand, to engage with customers and to earn their trust, while at the same time keeping a business sound and healthy. This challenge put my programming skils to the test everyday while at the same time taught me so much about Economics and Management, which I never thought I would enjoy so much.

But as every good thing comes to an end, in the beggining of 2020 I decided I needed a new challenge and to pursue my dream of being a full-time Data Scientist, and I was recruited to work at Jumia, African e-commerce platform that is changing people's lives one click at a time. At Jumia I had the opportunity of contacting with a much larger volume of data and a much wide variety of customers, as well as to observe the differences that culture has on shopping habits. It has been a short challenge, but it surely has been challenging!

### Hobbies

"All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!" - Isn't it true?

Usually on my free time you can catch me knitting (yes, like the old ladies), watching Science Fiction and Fantasy tv-series (Westworld and Penny Dreadful are my latest obcessions) and reading Sci-Fi novels (The Strain and Metro Saga are my all time favorites!)

Also, I very much enjoy playing with my two lovely kitties, Alice and Xica! :cat:
